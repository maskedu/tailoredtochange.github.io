<p>Not only does the fast fashion industry affect the environment, but it also affects the qualify of life for people living in third world countries where most garments are being produced and their employment with these companies. But this does limit the social effects to just third world countries, it has taken a toll on our local manufacturing here in New Zealand. </p>

    <div class="content">
      <p>Most of the 75 million garment workers that are located in China and Bangladesh just to name a few countries are usually females in their teens or younger. Imagine yourself as a teenager or perhaps you’re a teenager yourself, could you believe that you’d like to work at such an early age to support your family and with little wages and in poor conditions? <br><br> Clothing is manufactured in developing countries because of the cheap labour costs and this is a given as we exist in a capitalist society where companies thrive off of profit rather than the focus on sustainability and getting rid of the fast fashion model. The cheap labour and fewer protections for workers in these developing countries mean cheaper prices for us consumers here in New Zealand purchasing these clothes from fast fashion giants such as ZARA and H&M. But also a bonus profit for fast fashion companies.  </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Landfill waste</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>The production line of these fast fashion companies work in poor conditions and deadly ones too. They have been described to “work under poorly ventilated rooms that are thick of fumes from the chemicals used to manufacture and dye clothes.” They make MORE than a thousand garments in the heat and in long hours, paid way lower than a living wage of $4 NZD. <br><br> These workers risk their lives to support their families and can’t afford to avoid a day of work as there is a lot of competition and the potential of getting fired is always possible. Even when one is sick and has passed out the day before, they still choose to come back the day after and sew. The production of fast fashion has caused injuries and deaths in which companies overlook building structure issues and the safety of workers because of the focus on profit. <br><br> Evidently, our freedom in New Zealand is more explicitly shown and fast fashion has violated the basic human rights of these workers. There’s Article 23: right to desirable work and Article 24: right to rest and leisure. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Usage of resources</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Manufacturing in New Zealand has become increasingly difficult due to the rise of fast fashion and the cheap prices of these garments that fast fashion companies produce. We have been conditioned to believe that these prices of $10 NZD a shirt is normal and I’ve always felt like this especially as I’m a teenager myself who didn’t have a regular source of income. We think that paying $90 for a t-shirt is an outrage but in fact, this is a very depiction of what it actually costs to manufacture at a sustainable price. This is what has caused manufacturers such as Auckland shoe manufacturer, Sandy Cooper to go out of business and she was last noted (2018) as mentioned to be moving to China because of this. The real price of fashion is out there but fast fashion has resulted in this conditioning towards cheap prices. </p>
